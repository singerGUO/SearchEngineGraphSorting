/* In this assignment, and all future ones, we are using Gradle, a
 * build manager.
 * 
 * The purpose of build managers like Gradle is to standardize and simplify
 * the process of managing a Java project. This is useful because different
 * IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ all have different standards and conventions
 * on how they expect their projects to be structured and organized.
 *
 * Having to manage settings for n different IDEs can be a pain, so we
 * simplify by telling them to all use Gradle instead.
 *
 * Other examples of build managers include Ant or Maven.
 * 
 * You do not need to know anything about Gradle or build managers to complete
 * this project, but if you're curious and want to learn more, take a look
 * at the Java Quickstart chapter in the Gradle user guide:
 * https://docs.gradle.org/3.1/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html
