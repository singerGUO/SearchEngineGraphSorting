     * Hints:
     *
     * 1. You should add extra fields to keep track of your iteration
     *    state. You can add as many fields as you want. If it helps,
     *    our reference implementation uses three (including the one we
     *    gave you).
     *
     * 2. Before you try and write code, try designing an algorithm
     *    using pencil and paper and run through a few examples by hand.
     *
     *    We STRONGLY recommend you spend some time doing this before
     *    coding. Getting the invariants correct can be tricky, and
     *    running through your proposed algorithm using pencil and
     *    paper is a good way of helping you iron them out.
     *
     * 3. Think about what exactly your *invariants* are. As a
     *    reminder, an *invariant* is something that must *always* be
     *    true once the constructor is done setting up the class AND
     *    must *always* be true both before and after you call any
     *    method in your class.
     *
     *    Once you've decided, write them down in a comment somewhere to
     *    help you remember.
     *
     *    You may also find it useful to write a helper method that checks
     *    your invariants and throws an exception if they're violated.
     *    You can then call this helper method at the start and end of each
     *    method if you're running into issues while debugging.
     *
     *    (Be sure to delete this method once your iterator is fully working.)
     *
     * Implementation restrictions:
     *
     * 1. You **MAY NOT** create any new data structures. Iterators
     *    are meant to be lightweight and so should not be copying
     *    the data contained in your dictionary to some other data
     *    structure.
     *
     * 2. You **MAY** call the `.iterator()` method on each IDictionary
     *    instance inside your 'chains' array, however.
